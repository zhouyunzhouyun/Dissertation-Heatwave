在全球气候变化持续加剧的背景下，极端高温事件呈现出更高的频次、强度和持续时间，严重威胁人类健康、生态系统稳定以及社会经济发展。中国作为全球人口数量第二的发展中国家，又是全球气候变化的敏感区和影响显著区，热浪事件发生频率和影响范围持续扩大，导致人口暴露于热浪的健康风险不断增加。近年来，国家高度重视极端高温事件的防范与应对，以减轻其对居民健康与社会经济的冲击。在此背景下，深入研究热浪事件及其影响下的人口暴露特征与健康风险具有重要的理论价值和现实意义。本研究首先从热浪的“自然—社会”双重属性出发，以灾害系统理论和风险管理框架为指导，基于多源温度数据、人口数据和社会经济统计数据等，通过多定义比较、多尺度分析、多群体评估和未来情景模拟，系统揭示了历史时期及未来情景下我国热浪事件的时空演变规律及其人口暴露的分布特征。同时，围绕热浪健康风险评估，构建了综合评估体系，并应用可解释的机器学习方法，揭示了我国热浪健康风险的时空变化机制。最后，研究结合空间视角的风险主导类型划分与时间视角的全过程风险管理框架，提出了应对热浪风险的综合管理策略。
Against the backdrop of intensifying global climate change, extreme heat events are occurring with increasing frequency, intensity, and duration, posing severe threats to human health, ecosystem stability, and socio-economic development. As the world’s second most populous developing country and a region highly sensitive to climate change, China has experienced a continued expansion in the frequency and impact range of heatwaves, leading to a growing health risk for populations exposed to extreme heat. In recent years, the Chinese government has attached great importance to the prevention and response to extreme heat events to mitigate their impacts on public health and socio-economic systems. Under this context, conducting in-depth research on heatwaves—particularly their population exposure characteristics and associated health risks—holds both significant theoretical value and practical relevance. This study adopts a dual “natural–social” attribute perspective on heatwaves, guided by disaster system theory and a risk management framework. Utilizing multi-source temperature datasets, population data, and socio-economic statistics, it integrates multi-definition comparisons, multi-scale analysis, multi-group assessments, and multi-scenario simulations to systematically reveal the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of heatwaves and population exposure across China during both historical and future periods. Furthermore, a composite index-based health risk assessment framework was developed, incorporating interpretable machine learning methods to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics and mechanisms of heatwave-related health risks. Ultimately, this study integrates spatially based risk-dominant typologies with a temporally oriented whole-process risk management framework to propose comprehensive strategies for managing heatwave risks.
